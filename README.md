Description
-----------
Designed in OpenSCAD.

My Westerly sailing boat has a rectangular-shaped shorepower socket and the faceplate was broken in half. 
Given its very exposed position in the cockpit, this is only to be expected, but purchasing a replacement proved very difficult. 
Fortunately the broken half had been kept by the previous owner, which enabled me to design an exact replica. 
And the beauty is that it will certainly be broken again, so I have printed a spare.
